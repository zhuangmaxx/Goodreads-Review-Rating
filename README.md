# Goodreads-Review-Rating

# Description
We want to predict the numerical rating associated with a review based on its text
content. For this we will be using the GoodReads review dataset which has the X reviews
with some associated metadata such as user and book IDs, and of course the numerical
rating as a number between 1 and 5 inclusive. Our project aims to see if it is possible to
reasonably and accurately make these predictions utilizing a neural network.
